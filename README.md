## Designed, Prototyped & Coded From Scratch to Demonstrate my Skillset. Powered by React, GraphQL, GSAP, & Gatsby

Incredibly responsive design prototyped and drawn from scratch in Figma then programmed with JavaScript.

#### 2023 UPDATE NOTE: 
Keep in mind this portfolio was created years ago and has received no functionality updates since then! 

If I redesigned it today I would improve many things about how I managed props, state, CSS and of course update the project to TypeScript!

## Features:

<ul>
<li>Interactive, Animated Homepage With Randomly Generated Background & Catch-Phrases on Each Page Load</li>
<li>Beyond Responsive: Dynamic Text, Images & Conditional Component Loading. Looks Great on ALL Screen Sizes</li>
<li>Site-Wide Day/Night Mode</li>
<li>100% Original Design Framework Coded From Scratch in CSS & Styled-Components</li>
